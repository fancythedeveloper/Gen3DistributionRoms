# Project Wonder (JoySpot Update)

With the included .bps patches, you'll be able to distribute event items introduced in the Generation 3 Pokémon games (Aurora Ticket, Mystic Ticket, etc.) as well as a few newly introduced custom events (Decoration Set as well as Mystery Gift). We've spent countless hours developing, testing, and collaborating with translation teams to give Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald version a breath of fresh air. Let's take a look to see what's included.

## Features

- Multi-Language support (English, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish), 
- 10 Patch files to convert into fully usable distribution ROMS,  
- New Custom Events (Decoration Set and Mystery Gift), 
- Pokémon Egg Distributions give random eggs to simulate the original Events, 
- And so many more Quality of Life changes!


## How to use

- Download or clone the GitHub repository to wherever on your computer.
- Download the [unmodified Aurora Ticket distribution ROM](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-aurora-ticket-distribution-usa-gba-cartridge-rom-download-usa.14901/) and place the ROM into the repository's folder.
- Open your patcher of choice. (Flips and RomPatcher.js are provided below.) 
- Choose the patch file you'd like to use.
- Select your unmodified Aurora Ticket Distribution ROM.
- Save your newly patched Distribution ROM. 
- Either load the ROM through an emulator or flash cart of your choice. (We cannot promise or guarantee our distributions will be compatible with the software or hardware you choose.)


## Equipment Required for Hardware users

- 2x GBA's, 
- 2x GBA Wireless Adapters, 
- 1x Flash Cart (We cannot guarantee compatibility for your Flash Cart of choice), 
- 1x Copy of Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen, or Emerald.

## Emulator Necessities

- Patched Distribution ROMs, 
- Emulator of choice that supports the wireless adapter (We cannot guarantee compatibility for your emulator of choice), 
- Legally dumped copy of Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen, or Emerald on your device.
## FAQ

#### Where's the Emerald or FireRed/LeafGreen version Distribution ROM?

Great question, unlike the previous release a few years ago. You're now able to distribute multiple events to both versions using one Distribution ROM, however Emerald exclusive events (Eon Ticket, Old Sea Map, and Decoration Set) will not send to FireRed/LeafGreen versions.

#### Will the distributions work for my (insert language here) copy?

Yes! This was a highly requested Quality of Life feature. We worked closely with translation teams for the French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish languages to give our community an unforgettable experience.
